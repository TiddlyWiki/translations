Spanish translation for TiddlyWiki
----------------------------------

This is a new version of the Spanish translation for TiddlyWiki in support of 
TW version 2.6.0. and up.

A completely ready to use empty Spanish TiddlyWiki v2.6.1 is provided,
as well as the language-plugin (locale.es.js) on its own.

So you can either download "locale.es.js" and apply it to your own TW as a 
systemConfig-tagged tiddler or download "TW261emptyES.html", and create/import 
your own tiddlers in that empty Spanish TW.


Your feedback is very much welcomed at "tiddlywiki (at) ton-van-rooijen (dot) nl".

P.S.
Complete ready to use older versions of a Spanish empty TiddlyWiki are still
available too:
TW260emptyES.html
TW253emptyES.html
TW243emptyES.html

"locale040.es.js" is the Spanish language file for TW v2.5.0 up until TW v2.5.3.
"locale037.es.js" is the Spanish language file for TW v2.4.0 up until TW v2.4.3.

P.P.S.S. and Acknowledgements (Jan.13, 2009):
It was by no means my intention to take over from Sergio González and/or
Pedro Domínguez, but their website couldn't be reached, and the language-file
on SVN was incorrect. I needed a valid Spanish translation and found one with
the help of Dave Gifford. Since I consider the Spanish language a very important
world-language I decided, in consultancy with Martin Budden, to publish this
version. So all credits for this translation are still for Sergio González and
Pedro Domínguez (and some for Dave Gifford for his contributions/corrections).
