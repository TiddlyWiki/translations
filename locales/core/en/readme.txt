This directory contains an example "translation" of TiddlyWiki into English.

Of course TiddlyWiki is already in English: the contents of this directory can be used as a template for a new translation.

Note that TiddlyWiki does not yet fully support the translation of tiddler titles. At the moment the only tidder title that should be translated is:

"GettingStarted" in locale.en.js

This tiddler is entitled "TranslatedGettingStarted" to indicate that it should be translated.

Note that the tiddler filenames themselves (thatis GettingStarted.tiddler) should not be translated.

See http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/tiddlywiki/wiki/Translations for more information on TiddlyWiki translations.
